**WARNING**  
I created this project just to make a point, that you don't need any library to make a simple user interface.  
**This project is outdated and has some dependencies that have security issues!** I will fix this soon, but for now: be warned :)

Dubf Almighty
=============

The name is kind of a joke. It occurred when friends and I planned a little movie night and I just made a typo:
**Dubf was born.** It escalated quickly and Dubf became a powerful oracle in our conversations.
 
So in memory of Dubf, this is going to be a random movie/series picker.
 
Best wishes
