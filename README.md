Dubf Almighty
=============

The name is kind of a joke. It occurred when friends and I planned a little movie night and I just made a typo:
**Dubf was born.** It escalated quickly and Dubf became a powerful oracle in our conversations.
 
So in memory of Dubf, this is going to be a random movie/series picker.
 
Since this is a weekend project and the weekend here in Europe just began, this is still in the making.
